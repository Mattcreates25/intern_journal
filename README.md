## __Hello!__

Here I will document my journey through ICIPE cohort 6 internship

## Vision

My vision for this intenship is to jumpstart my career as a bioinformatician and network with others in the field. I would also like to be able to submit a useful library in R  that can be used to analyse protemoic and/or genomic data.


## Day one(understanding github)

### markdown
markdown is a way to format text  on github


### forking and cloning
forking a repository is basically making a copy of an already existing project that you can work on seperately. while cloning is allows you to have a copy of the file on your PC.

if the changes you've made to the project are useful then you can make a pull request for the changes to be added. here is a link to my first attempt [link][1]

### Why fork  
1. Use someone's project as a starting point for yours
2. Make proposal edits to someones work.
