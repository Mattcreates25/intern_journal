# __Intern_journal__

## __Hello!__

Here I will document my journey through ICIPE cohort 6 internship

## Vision

My vision for this intenship is to jumpstart my career as a bioinformatician and network with others in the field. I would also like to be able to submit a useful package in R  that can be used to analyse and visualize protemoic and/or genomic data. to this end I will need to:

1. understnad additional tools that are used by bioinformaticians
2. utilize the trainers wealth of information and time to the fullest
3. tap into the strengths of my teammates and share any information I have gained hitherto.

## Day one(understanding git and github)

### forking and cloning
forking a repository is basically making a copy of an already existing project that you can work on seperately. while cloning is allows you to have a copy of the file on your PC.

if the changes you've made to the project are useful then you can make a pull request for the changes to be added. here is a link to my first attempt [link][1]

### Why fork  
1. Use someone's project as a starting point for yours
2. Make proposal edits to someones work.

### markdown
markdown is a way to format text  on github
