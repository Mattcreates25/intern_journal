## __Hello!__

__Greetings and welcome__  thank you for checking ut my page , having a molecular and cellular biology background I found myself drawn to the multidisciplinary of bioinformatics during my first attachement. I have taken steps to further the need for  I  Here I will document my journey through ICIPE cohort 6 internship

## Vision

My vision for this intenship is to jumpstart my career as a bioinformatician and network with others in the field. Apart from I would also like to be able to submit a useful package in R to the CRAN that can be used to analyse and visualize protemoic and/or genomic data. to this end I will need to:

1. Understnad additional tools that are used by bioinformaticians
2. Utilize the trainers wealth of information and time to the fullest
3. Tap into the strengths of my teammates and solve problems that I've encountered in R studio.
4. 
5. Share any information I have gained hitherto.

## __Mission__

My main mission is to contribute to the scientific community by using the skills I'll learn from this internship to unlock different secrets of the molecular world, secerts that could potentially cure disease. Using programming tools I would like to help generate reusable code that could  

## Day one(understanding git and github)

### forking and cloning
forking a repository is basically making a copy of an already existing project that you can work on seperately. while cloning is allows you to have a copy of the file on your PC.

if the changes you've made to the project are useful then you can make a pull request for the changes to be added. here is a link to my first attempt [link][1]

### Why fork  

1. Use someone's project as a starting point for yours
2. Make proposal edits to someones work.

### markdown

markdown is a way to format text  on github

# __ROAD MAP__

## __milestone 1__
getting to understand git and guthub and its uses.


## __milestone 2__
understanding the command line in Ubuntu linux

## __milestone 3__
find more application with python as a programming language

## __milestone 4__
visualize data on an ongoing project here at icipe

## __milestone 5__ 

Identify the type of sequences I would like my library to query 

1. nucleic acid(DNA/RNA) or protein sequences
2. types of organisms or viruses to focus on.
3. 

## __milestone 6__
collect nucleic acid and/or proteomic information that will be included in the repository for my library

## __miletsone 7__


## __milestone 7__
generate useful functions that will allow for manipulation of collected data
1. A function to call sequences from the selected repository
2. A function to
